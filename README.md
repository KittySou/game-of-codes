<h1 align="center"> Game of Codes 🕹️ </h1>

## → Pain 🤕
<p>In the era where the Internet is our #1 resource to obtain any type of information, it can become overhelming at times.</p>

## → Target 🎯
<p>People with no coding experience but tech-savy having the desire to learn programming.</p>

## → Solution 💡
<p>A simple interactive game app aiming to introduce non-coders to the basics of Ruby.</p>

<br>

<p>As our final project of the bootcamp, we encountered many challenges : create a figma product, work in teams, figure out merge conflicts and finally deploy on heroku.</p>
