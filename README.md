# Game of Codes 🕹️
<p>A simple interactive game app aiming to introduce non-coders to the basics of Ruby.</p>

<br>

## Pain 🤕
<p>In the era where the Internet is our #1 resource to obtain any type of information, it can become overhelming at times.</p>

<br>

## Target 🎯
<p>People with no coding experience but tech-savy having the desire to learn programming.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>As our final project of the bootcamp, we encountered many challenges : create a figma product, work in teams, figure out merge conflicts and finally deploy on heroku.</p>

<p>Check out our presentation on demo day at Le Wagon's Montreal campus on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/events/demoday-full-timewebdevelopment7101903523700690945/theater/" target="_blank">Linked In</a>.</p>

<p> Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team. </p>
